## Map Description

This map was designed to illustrate the wide range of soccer club attendance accross the state of North Carolina. There are several types of soccer clubs ranging from amateur all the way to professional. I chose the symbolization to be circles so that the user can easily hover over the circle to get information on it. And since there are many clubs around Charlotte it is good that the user can zoom in to see them in more detail, as well as being able to understand their proximity to one another better.
